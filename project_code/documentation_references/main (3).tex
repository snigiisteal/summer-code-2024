\chapter{SYSTEM DESIGN}
Design is the abstraction of a solution it is a general description of the solution to a problem without the details. Design is view patterns seen in the analysis phase to be a pattern in a design phase. After design phase we can reduce the time required to create the implementation.\\
\hspace*{35pt}A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.\\ \\
\textbf{What is UML?}\\
UML is an acronym that stands for Unified Modelling Language. Simply put, UML is a modern approach to modelling and documenting software. In fact, it’s one of the most popular business process modelling techniques.\\
It is based on diagrammatic representations of software components. As the old proverb says: “a picture is worth a thousand words”. By using visual representations, we are able to better understand possible flaws or errors in software or business processes.\\\\
\textbf{Building Blocks of the UML:} The vocabulary of the UML encompasses three kinds of building blocks.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Things:} Things are the abstractions that are first-class citizens in a model
	\item \textbf{Relationships:} ; relationships tie these
	things together
	\item \textbf{Diagrams:} diagrams group interesting collections of things
\end{itemize}
\section{Use Case Diagram}
Use case diagrams are a set of use cases, actors, and their relationships. They represent the use case view of a system.\\
\hspace*{35pt}A use case represents a particular functionality of a system. Hence, use case diagram is used to describe the relationships among the functionalities and their internal/external controllers. These controllers are known as actors. In this project, JNTUHUCES Student, Guest/new Admission, Admin are the actors\\

\section{Class Diagram}
Class diagram is a static diagram. It represents the static view of an application. Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, describing, and documenting different aspects of a system but also for constructing executable code of the software application.\\
\hspace*{35pt}Class diagram describes the attributes and operations of a class and also the constraints imposed on the system. The class diagrams are widely used in the modelling of object-oriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams, which can be mapped directly with object-oriented languages.Class diagram shows a collection of classes, interfaces, associations, collaborations, and constraints. It is also known as a structural diagram. \\

\section{Flow Chart Diagram}
A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.\\
\hspace*{35pt}The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{DataFLow.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Flow Chart diagram}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\section{Sequence Diagram}
A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) visually represents the dynamic interactions and chronological order of messages between various objects or components within a system. Lifelines, depicted as vertical dashed lines, symbolize the existence of objects over time. Actors, often represented as stick figures, denote external entities interacting with the system. Messages, depicted as arrows flowing vertically between lifelines, illustrate communication events. Activation bars on lifelines indicate the period during which an object is active, processing a message. Return messages, denoted by dashed lines with arrows, signify the flow of control back to the message sender. Self-messages, represented by looped arrows, depict an object sending a message to itself. Interaction occurrences frame repeated sequences of messages, enhancing the diagram's expressiveness.

In essence, a sequence diagram provides a dynamic view of a system, allowing developers and analysts to understand the chronological flow of interactions between system components. This visual representation aids in designing, analyzing, and documenting the behavior of complex systems, fostering a comprehensive understanding of how objects collaborate and communicate during the execution of a particular scenario.

	\end{center}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\section{Activity Diagram}
Activity diagrams are used to document workflows in a system, from
the business level down to the operational level. The general purpose
of Activity diagrams is to focus on flows driven by internal processing
vs. external events. Activities are nothing but the functions of a system.
Numbers of activity diagrams are prepared to capture the entire flow in a
system.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}

	\end{center}
	\caption{Activity Diagram}
\end{figure}
\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the use case diagram encapsulates user-system interactions, guiding system design based on scenarios, while the class diagram delineates the structural framework by illustrating relationships between classes. The sequence diagram offers a dynamic view of message flow during scenarios, aiding in the identification of key functionalities, and the flow chart diagram provides a step-by-step representation of system processes, enhancing transparency in the virtual assistant's workflow. Collectively, these diagrammatic representations facilitate a holistic understanding of the virtual assistant's functionality, structure, dynamics, and operational flow, serving as invaluable tools for effective design, development, and communication of the system's intricacies.
